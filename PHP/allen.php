    <article>
        <p>Henry Allen was born in Southampton, Hampshire, England around 1882, the son of Charles and Elizabeth
            Allen.</p>
        <p>He was married in 1900 in Southampton to Cecilia Reid. They would have 10 children, only 7 of whom lived past
            infancy: Emily (b. 1901), Annie Cecilia (b. 1902), William Henry (b. 1905), Charles Edward (b. 1907), Alfred
            James (b. 1909), Clara (b. 1910), and Eliza (b. 1912)</p>
        <p>On the 1901 census a 19-year-old Henry is living with his wife and first child Emily at 6 Mount Street,
            Southampton. On the 1911 census the family are at 3 Wickham Court, French Street, Vyse Lane,
            Southampton.</p>
        <p>When he signed on to the Titanic he gave the same address as that he was living at on the 1911 census and
            stated that his last ship had been the Oceanic. As a fireman he would receive pay of Â£6 per month.</p>
        <p>Allen died in the sinking. His body was recovered by the Mackay-Bennett, and was buried at Fairview Cemetary,
            Halifax, Nova Scotia on 8 May 1912.</p>
        <p>Henry's widow Cecilia was remarried in 1914 to William F. Dollery and would have further children. She died
            in 1948 in Southampton. Henry's last surviving child Clara died in 2003.</p>
