        <h1>Mr James Anderson</h1>
    </article>
    <article>
        <p>Mr James Anderson, 40, was born in Newcastle.</p>
        <p>When he signed-on to the Titanic, on 6 April 1912, he gave his address as 1 Cozens Court, (Lime St,
            Southampton)1. His last ship had been the Cape Colona. As an able bodied seaman he received monthly wages of
            Â£5.</p>
        <p>Anderson was rescued in lifeboat 3.</p>
        <p>What became of James anderson after this date remains a mystery but articles in the South Wales Echo and
            South Wales Daily News in 1914 describe a man named John Anderson, a "survivor of the Titanic", who had
            escaped from a mental asylum.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p class="p-crew-quote">South Wales Daily News</p>
            <p class="p-crew-quote-white"><b>Escape from Whitchurch</b></p>
            <p class="p-crew-quote">29th June 1914</p>
            <p class="p-crew-quote-white"><b>Search for Patient who was in The Titanic</b></p>
            <p class="p-crew-quote">The authorities of the City of Cardiff Mental Hospital have been much perturbed
                since Thursday by the escape of one of the patients from that institution.</p>
            <p class="p-crew-quote">John Anderson, a man of the seafaring class, of medium build, and about 40 years
                of age, has been missing since that day, and all efforts to trace him both by the asylum officials and
                the police have proved futile. Fortunately Anderson is a man of quiet disposition, and is suffering from
                a shock sustained when the Titanic sank, being one of the crew of that ill fated ship and only left the
                vessel in the last boat-load of those who escaped.</p>
            <p class="p-crew-quote">Anderson was a native of Southampton, where he resided with his brother, and
                inquiries are now being made in that town in the hope that the man may be traced. It is believed that
                Anderson had spent some time in the Cardiff district selling mementoes of the Titanic, and is thought he
                may return to the locality with a view to earning a livelihood.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>There was no one of that name on the Titanic and there is no evidence that this man was James Anderson but it
            remains a faint possibility.</p>
