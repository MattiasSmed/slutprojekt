        <h2>
            How many Titanic survivors were there?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Sources disagree on the actual number, ranging from 705 to 713. But the odds of surviving were definitely
            higher for upper-class women and children, and female crew members.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rescue of first class passengers was not a general priority; although all but four of the 140 women
            traveling first class survived, only 57 of the 175 men were saved. There were 80 female survivors out of 93
            traveling second class, but only 14 out of 168 men. Third class survival rates were even worse; 76 of 165
            women were rescued, but the list of survivors shows only 75 out of 462 men.

        <h2>
            Oldest, youngest and longest-lived passengers
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Titanic passengers ranged in age from 71 years to 73 days. The two oldest women, Mary Compton and
            Catherine Crosby, both aged 64, survived. The three oldest men, Ramon Artagaveytia, George Goldschmidt and
            Henry Mitchell, all aged 71, did not.</p>
        <p>
            The youngest passenger was 2-month-old Elizabeth Gladys Millvina Dean. Although almost all 30 of the
            children traveling in first and second class survived, only 27 of the 79 children in third class were
            rescued.
            Millvina Dean and her brother, Bertram, who was a few weeks short of his second birthday, were among them.
            Their mother also survived, but their 25-year-old father did not.
        </p>
        <p>
            Coincidentally, Millvina Dean was the last of the Titanic survivors; the 97-year-old spinster died in 2009.
            Bertram Vere Dean also made the list of longest-lived survivors. He died at age 81 on the 80th anniversary
            of the sinking: April 14, 1992.

        <h2>A Titanic Story of the Dean Family's Loss and Survival</h2>
        <p>Millvina Dean was the last surviving passenger of the ill-fated passenger ship. She was lowered into a
            lifeboat inside a mail sack on the fateful night that the ship sank into the depths and took so many lives
            with her. Millvina Dean passed away at the age of 97 in a nursing home that was located in Southampton,
            England. </p>
        <p>Southampton was the same English port that the RSM Titanic launched from on it's voyage into history. Ms.
            Dean was only 9 weeks old when she was lowered to safety onto lifeboat number ten along with her mother Mrs.
            Eva Georgetta Light Dean. Mrs. Eva Dean was aged 32 at the time of the disaster. She and her daughter, Miss
            Elizabeth Gladys Dean, who was later known as Millvina, was traveling in 3rd class when they were placed
            into lifeboat number 10. Mrs. Dean became separated from her young son, Master Bertram Vere Dean, who was
            but one year old at that time. She comforted herself with the thought that her son and her husband were
            together on board the Titanic and would be able to get into another lifeboat and join herself and her
            daughter upon rescue. While the mother, baby sister and young brother were reunited on board the Carpathia,
            Mrs. Deans husband, Bertram Frank Dean was numbered among those lost at sea.</p>
        <p>Miss Dean never married and lived quietly without much thought to that fateful night until the world found
            her after a renewed interest in the disaster surfaced upon the popular movies premiere in 1996. The movie
            starred Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as passengers of the Titanic. Miss Dean survived her brother
            Bertram Frank Dean, who died on April 14 in 1992. Her mother, Eva Dean, preceded her in death on September
            13 in 1975. Millvina's father, Mr. Bertram Frank Dean was only 25 years old at the time of his death aboard
            the Titanic. His occupation was listed as a farmer and his last residence was listed as Bartley Farm in
            Hampshire, England. All four members of the Dean family shared ticket numbers 2315 on their fateful trip. In
            a twist of fate, this last surviver of the Titanic passed away on the anniversary that would be number 98 of
            the great ships launching. </p>
        <p>The story of Charles John Joughin is but one of the many survivor stories. Mr. Joughin was born on August 3
            of 1879 and was 32 years old at the time of the Titanic sinking. His occupation was that of Chief Baker
            aboard the great ship. Some attribute his survival to the ingestion of not just one but two bottles of
            whiskey before the boat slipped beneath the frigid waters of the ocean. Mr. Joughin rode the ship into the
            water much like the characters of Rose and Jack did in the movie. He stepped into the ocean and did not even
            get his head wet on the ride. He was rescued after 3 hours in the icy, cold water by lifeboat B and boarded
            the Carpathia. He died on December 9 of 1956 and is buried in Patterson, New Jersey in the United States at
            Cedar Lawn Cemetery. </p>
        <p>Joughin performed his duties and carried the supplies to the lifeboats. He has been depicted as a simple
            drunk in some renditions of the story of the Titanic but, in truth, he helped people into the lifeboats,
            insured that they had supplies for survival and tossed items that he thought might float in an effort to
            give people who might end up in the ocean water something on which to hold onto. He did imbibe in large
            amounts of alcohol but that has been attributed to his surviving the icy water while many others did
            not.</p>
        <p>Joughin's first voyage aboard a ship was in the capacity of Cabin Boy in 1896 on the SS Melbourne. He
            traveled aboard that ship to South America on his first journey. Joughin was said to enjoy drinking alcohol
            his entire life.

        <h2>The Habitual Survivor</h2>
        <p>
            Miss Violet Constance Jessop was another on the list of Titanic survivors. She was a nurse and stewardess on
            the ocean liner. Violet was a surviver three times over. She also survived, in 1915 the sister ship of
            Titanic, the Britannic tragedy. Violet was also on board the RMS Olympic at the time that is collided with
            the HMS Hawke. She was aged 24 years at the time of the sinking of the Titanic. Violet passed away on May 5
            of 1971 and is buried in Hartest in Suffold, England.</p>
        <p>There are 710 stories of the survivors who lived on that fateful night. They are all as interesting and
            compelling as the individuals who survived that night in history.</p>
